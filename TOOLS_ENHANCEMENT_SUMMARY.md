# Tools Enhancement Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully added two powerful new tools to the React Agent ecosystem:

1. **Command Line Tool** - Safe command execution with security restrictions
2. **File Manager Tool** - Comprehensive file operations with sandboxing

## 🛠️ New Tools Added

### 1. Command Line Tool (`tools/command_line_tool.py`)

**Purpose**: Execute shell commands safely with comprehensive security features.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Whitelist Security**: Only allows 77 pre-approved safe commands
- ✅ **Blocked Commands**: Prevents 35 dangerous operations (rm, sudo, etc.)
- ✅ **Timeout Protection**: 30-second execution timeout
- ✅ **Output Limits**: 10KB output size limit to prevent memory issues
- ✅ **Safe Pipe Operations**: Allows secure command chaining
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

**Supported Operations**:
- **File Operations**: `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `find`
- **System Info**: `ps`, `top`, `df`, `du`, `uname`, `whoami`
- **Network**: `ping`, `curl`, `wget`, `nslookup`
- **Development**: `git`, `python`, `pip`, `node`, `npm`
- **Text Processing**: `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `awk`, `sed`

**Security Features**:
```python
# Blocked dangerous commands
BLOCKED_COMMANDS = {
    'rm', 'sudo', 'chmod', 'shutdown', 'kill', 'nc', ...
}

# Only allow safe commands
SAFE_COMMANDS = {
    'ls', 'cat', 'grep', 'git', 'python', 'ping', ...
}
```

### 2. File Manager Tool (`tools/file_manager_tool.py`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive file management with safety controls and sandboxing.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Safe Mode**: Prevents access to system directories
- ✅ **Sandbox Environment**: Isolated file operations
- ✅ **Extension Filtering**: Only allows safe text file extensions
- ✅ **Size Limits**: 10MB max file size for reading
- ✅ **Automatic Backups**: Creates backups before destructive operations
- ✅ **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents directory escape attacks

**Supported Operations**:

#### File Operations
- `read_file(path)` - Read text file content
- `write_file(path, content)` - Create/write files
- `append_file(path, content)` - Append to files
- `copy_file(source, dest)` - Copy files/directories
- `move_file(source, dest)` - Move/rename files
- `delete_file(path)` - Delete with backup

#### Directory Operations
- `list_directory(path)` - List directory contents
- `create_directory(path)` - Create directories
- `find_files(pattern, dir)` - Find files by pattern
- `search_in_files(text, dir)` - Search file contents

#### Information & Analysis
- `file_info(path)` - Get file metadata
- `file_exists(path)` - Check file existence
- `file_hash(path)` - Calculate MD5/SHA256 hashes

**Security Features**:
```python
# Safe file extensions only
SAFE_TEXT_EXTENSIONS = {
    '.txt', '.md', '.json', '.csv', '.py', '.js', ...
}

# Blocked system directories
BLOCKED_DIRECTORIES = {
    '/etc', '/bin', '/System', '/Applications', ...
}
```

## 🔧 Integration

### Tool Manager Updates

Both tools have been integrated into:
- ✅ `agent/tool_manager.py` - Basic tool manager
- ✅ `tools/enhanced_tool_manager.py` - Enhanced tool manager with MySQL
- ✅ `tools/__init__.py` - Package exports

### Usage Examples

#### Command Line Tool
```python
# System information
"uname -a"  # Get system info
"ps aux | head -10"  # Show top processes
"df -h"  # Check disk space

# Development tasks
"git status"  # Check git status
"python --version"  # Check Python version
"find . -name '*.py'"  # Find Python files

# Network operations
"ping -c 3 google.com"  # Test connectivity
"curl -I https://api.github.com"  # Check API status
```

#### File Manager Tool
```python
# File operations
"write_file('config.json', '{\"debug\": true}')"
"read_file('config.json')"
"copy_file('config.json', 'config.backup.json')"

# Directory operations
"list_directory('/project/src')"
"create_directory('logs')"

# Search operations
"find_files('*.py', '/project')"
"search_in_files('TODO', '/project')"

# Analysis
"file_info('large_file.txt')"
"file_hash('important.txt')"
```
